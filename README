INSTALLATION
================================================================================

You must have:
	libgnutls-dev
	libusb-dev
	libfuse-dev (and the associated kernel modules)
	libglib2.0-dev
	libxml2-dev
	make
	autoheader
	automake
	autoconf
	gcc

IMPORTANT: You must edit src/ifuse.c and src/main.c and replace your HostID
from the plist file stored by iTunes. You can find these lines because they are
currently commented out. In Windows this file is located in:

C:\Documents and Settings\Your Username\Application Data\Apple Computer\Lockdown\<device serial number>.plist
	
IMPORTANT: You must also have a public certificate for the device located in
the root directory of the source named hostcert.pem. This can also be extracted
from the above file.

To compile run:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

USAGE
================================================================================

There are currently 2 executables iphoneclient and ifuse, located in src/.

iphoneclient is a basic commandline interface, it just runs a few various operations.

ifuse is a Fuse filesystem which allows you to mount your iPhone to a directory
like this:

	./src/ifuse mountpoint

To unmount:
	umount mountpoint

Currently the ifuse filesystem is read-only, until the development has
progressed further.
