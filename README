INSTALLATION
================================================================================

For:
	Apple iPhone/iPod Touch 1.0/1.1/1.1.1/1.2/1.3/2.0+
	+ iPod USB cable

You must have:
	libgnutls-dev
	libusb-dev
	libfuse-dev (and the associated kernel modules)
	libglib2.0-dev
	libxml2-dev
	make
	autoheader
	automake
	autoconf
	gcc

To compile run:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install  # (if you want to install it into your system directories)
	libiphone-initconf  # (as the user you intend to user the library)

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can do:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf \
          libgnutls-dev libusb-dev libfuse-dev libglib2.0-dev libxml2-dev \
          libreadline5-dev

USAGE
================================================================================

Now comes the fun bit!

== Generating keys ==

IMPORTANT: Before using the library you must run "libiphone-initconf"
as your own user (not root). It will generate keys and a host id for your
system to be able to communicate with 'lockdownd' on the iPhone.

It will probably take 5-10 minutes, but thankfully only needs to be
run _once_.   It MUST be run otherwise communication will not work:

	libiphone-initconf

The generated keys are saved in '~/.config/libiphone/' in your home directory.
